## 🔍 My Projects

### [Car Price Predictor](https://github.com/JoaoCA98/Used-Cars-Price-Prediction)
Predicting used car prices with a hyper-tuned MLP algorithm. Achieved an impressive R-squared of 0.983 (Train) and 0.920 (Test). Let's not underestimate the power of the right features!

### [Hotel Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/yourusername/hotel-customer-segmentation)
Clustered hotel customers to identify distinct groups for personalized marketing strategies. Implemented K-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical Clustering to bring out the hidden patterns.

### [Churn Prediction System](https://github.com/yourusername/churn-prediction-system)
Developed a robust churn prediction system for a telecom company using Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Networks. Achieved 89% accuracy, leading to data-driven retention strategies.
