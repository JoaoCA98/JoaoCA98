## 🔍 My Projects

### [Car Price Predictor](https://github.com/JoaoCA98/Used-Cars-Price-Prediction)
Predicting used car prices with a hyper-tuned MLP algorithm. Achieved an impressive R-squared of 0.983 (Train) and 0.920 (Test). Let's not underestimate the power of the right features!

### [Hotel Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/JoaoCA98/Customer_Segmentation)
Clustered hotel customers to identify distinct groups for personalized marketing strategies. Implemented K-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical Clustering to bring out the hidden patterns.

### [Recommendation System](https://github.com/JoaoCA98/Marketing-Strategy-Enhancement-With-Data-Science)
RFM Model for segmentation and Similarity analysis to derive insightful recommendations.

### [Marketing Campaign Response Prediction](https://github.com/JoaoCA98/Campaign_Response)
Empowered the marketing team with a prediction model to identify potential customers for a campaign. Explored Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and XGBoost to maximize campaign efficiency.

### [House Price Prediction](https://github.com/JoaoCA98/House-Price-Prediction)
Explored the famous Boston Housing dataset, building a model that predicts house prices. Achieved R-squared values of 0.80 (Train) and 0.72 (Test), showing the importance of understanding local market trends.
